# Champions of Meridian59 (CoM)

## Preparation

Before the game starts, all players will be informed that they need to register as a champion for the upcoming challenge.

Registration is done by purchasing a ballot from Caramo. This must be labeled with the words "Champions of Meridian59" as opposed to voting for a new Justiciar. 

If the champion also meets the following requirements, they may participate in the Battle for Glory:
- at least 120 hit points
- at least 12 circles
- no guardian angel (opt-out)

## Gameplay

At the start of the battle, all champions who have a valid ballot and meet the prerequisites will be teleported to the battlefield.

If a champion has less than 8 items equipped, they will receive basic equipment.

It also replenishes the healing wands in your inventory to 5, plus any reagents for spells you've already learned.

The ballot disappears into thin air....

The battle begins and all the rules that apply outside the battlefield apply here as well.
If a champion dies on the battlefield, it is considered a real death.
Spells such as "Rescue", "Truce", or "Animate Dead" and the use of a "Goblet of Rain" are considered dishonorable and are therefore forbidden.

A real battle would not live up to its reputation if there was no way to reinforce your troops.
Therefore, the system offers the possibility to teleport waves of additional champions from your own ranks into the battle at regular intervals of 3 minutes. These are also equipped before the battle as described.

## Goal of the game

All champions who are still standing and breathing at the end of the battle are declared the winner and receive 500 champion points.

The remaining champions who participated and survived at least 3 waves will receive 150 champion points.

Killing a champion will earn you additional 100 champion points.

## Rewards

- 500 Champion Points : any equipment (bound)
- 3000 Champion Points : colored equipment (bound)
