// Notes from the dawn of time:
// Here are some things I have had NPC's hint at, things we can add in the
// future:
//        -30 years ago, we traded with people north of the Great Ocean, but we
//         can no longer sail ships, so we don't know what's happened to them.
//        -Two generations ago, there were no monsters in Meridian other than
//         your usual spider.  No one knows where they come from or why.  Only 
//         that they're getting worse.
//        -Far'Nohl (the ghost) also died at about this time.  
//        -Hints of the volcano and swamp we'll be adding.
//        -The Treefolk south of Marion were once gentle, but now are 
//         aggressively expanding their territory.  No one knows why.
//        -A carving dug up in Marion, with a fire killing the digger in his 
//         home soon after.
//        -Jasper, the border town, is fighting a losing battle with monsters.
//        -Cor Noth is developing a pollution problem

  //    ****All of these respond to GetXXXX or SetXXXX,#value=yyyy
  // Lists:     SignetRings = all the signets in the game.
  //            SignetNewbies = newbies who have created or delivered signets.
  //
  // Newbies are those who are not pk enabled.
  // On newbie kill, if the newbie is not on plSignetNewbies, then signet is
  // generated based on SignetChance. The newbie is added to plSignetNewbies.
  // The signet is added to plSignetRings. both These lists are pruned to be
  // less than their Max values. Pruned newbies are free to earn signets again.
  // Pruned rings are deleted (basically a delivery timeout...) Initially the
  // rings and newbies are set at 20... These may need to be tweaked so that
  // there is 30min or so to deliver signets when play is crowded with newbies.
  //
  // Upon creation, a mob is selected to be the receiver of the signet. The
  // signetring class is added to their plWantedItems List, and the mob is
  // stored as the poRingOwner in the signet itself. When offered to the mob,
  // the CheckWhyWanted routine is chosen, and it determines that the signet
  // offered is the one desired, and then gives a bonus money amount. If its
  // not the proper ring, its returned to the player. If it is the right ring
  // the newbie is again added to the plSignetNewbies list. The SignetRing
  // class is removed from the mob's plWantedItem list. It is also unregisterd
  // from the library (removed from the plSignetRings list).
  //
  // If needed, the ClearSignets routine in the library can be called to do
  // a restart of all signets. Also, the SetSignetLock routine can be called
  // to prevent the generation of any future signets. 
  // 
  // If a signet is dropped, or left on the ground, it will eventually blink
  // (like the tokens) to the center of the room. This is to keep them out
  // of the water. Also, if a non-newbie returns the token, then they dont
  // get any money and their name is added to the plSignetNewbies list (in
  // effect bumping a real newbie off the list).
  //
  // When a signet is deleted, it sends a message to a logged on user
  // that is holding it, which indicates that the player lost the ring.
  // This might happen if the player takes too long to deliver it.
  // If the player logs off with the ring, it will likely be gone when they
  // log back on the next day. Currently there is no message for this.
  // it may be seen as a bug. Any suggestions on dealing with this are
  // appreciated.
