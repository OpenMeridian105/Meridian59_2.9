      "(the Lich, Queen Venya'cyr).  The items offered large stat and building "

      "an attack from Miriana destroying Cor Noth, the introduction of dark "
      "angels in node attacks and the ability for players to teach each other "

      "Purify's negative effects were split into a new spell (Purge) and much "
