      "More frequently, after killing a monster you will find items "
      "that you yourself have no need for but that you can sell to get "
      "the weapons and other equipment that you do need.  For example, "
      "you may have found entroot berries after killing some mummies.  "
      "Use the OFFER command, or press the CONTROL key and O to offer "
      "these to Ravi, the apothecary.\n\n"
      "It should be noted that not every NPC wants every item.  Ravi, for "
      "example, has no interest in purchasing weapons so if you offer them "
      "to him, it will confuse him.  He may even think that it's a gift, "
      "and take it from your astonished hands.  If you SAY 'buy' or 'sell', "
